# Material for my Predictive Maintenance class

I was asked to set up a short (6 hours) introduction to Predictive Maintenance in 2018. The audience was composed of (French) Maintenance Master students, with no background in Machine Learning nor Data Science.

I took a "use case" oriented approach, with the following target skills:
- explain the workflow of data analysis for Predictive Maintenance problems;
- know the main bottlenecks and challenges of data-driven approaches to Maintenance;
- link the Predictive Maintenance problems to their formal Machine Learning counterparts;
- know the main categories of Machine Learning algorithms and which formal problem they solve;
- know the name of some key methods in Machine Learning;
- know the existence of sciki-learn and its API.
